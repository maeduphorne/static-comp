## Abstract

This project was a solo project in Module 2 of Turing. The main purpose of the project was to practice with HTML and CSS - particularly Grid and Flexbox. We were given a comp to match layout and complexity, but given creative license in the theme and content. I chose to create a dog adoption website so I could look at cute puppies for a few days.

## Technologies
  - HTML
  - CSS
